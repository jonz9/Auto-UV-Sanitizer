Test #1: 

The sanitization LEDs will be active for 30 seconds during each cycle. 

To set up this test, the STM32 is required to programmed and connected to power. 

The room should be dim enough so that the LEDs are clearly visible, and the area of effect is visible and apparent.

The test input in this case will be the computer program that is coded into the STM32. When the program is executed, the UV-C LEDs is expected to turn on for certain time intervals. 
The tester will use a stopwatch and measure the time in seconds accurate to two decimal places, this will be repeated for multiple cycles do ensure accuracy.

When the LED becomes active, a tester will start a stopwatch and time the activation process. 

This test is passed if the timed activation is within 30s±0.5s. 






Test #2: 

There will be an indicator LED during the sanitization process that activates, flashing once every two seconds for one second during the sanitation process. 

To set up this, the indicator LED is required to be connected to the jumper wires of which are also connected to the breadboard. While pointing out the side of the 3D-printed mechanism container, the code for the indicator LED will also be programmed into the STM32 beforehand.

Unlike Test #1, the dimness of the environment matters less as the indicator LED is not programmed with the intention to have a specific area of effect, but rather to be clear enough to users that the activation of the UV-C sanitization process is currently ON. 
The input for this test on the indicator LED is also the computer program in C++ that, when executed, causes the indicator LED to turn on for the time interval that the UV-C LEDs are activated.

The quantifiable measurement standard for this test is similar to Test #1; a tester is again using a stopwatch and measuring in seconds. The tester starts the stopwatch when the indicator LED is ON and stops it right as it stops.

The test is passed if the timer holds a time within the interval of 1s±0.10s, and the light is seen to have blinked 15 times during the sanitation process (30s/2s).






Test #3:

The system will cover and sanitize the total area of the top, back, and front of the door handle. 

To set up this test, measurements need to be made on the door handle that is to be tested on by the mechanism. The door handle should be in the shape of a symmetrical rectangle for this test to be precise. 

The environment should again be very dim, as the area covered by the effect of the LED is being tested to check if it covers the entire top, back, and front of the handle. 

In this case, the test input will be the program that activates the device. There are other factors that cause the LED light rays to shine onto the correct amount of surface area, such as the shape of the light tunnel and the distance of the LEDs to the door handle, but the main input that activates the device is still the instructions written in C++. 

The measurement standard for this test is done in cm2 , as the area of effect is calculated to verify this test. The total area needed to be covered by the LEDs is the sum of the area of the top, back, and front of the door handle, which should be measurable.

The test is passed if the area of the lit-up sections of the door handle is clearly seen through the dimness of the environment.
