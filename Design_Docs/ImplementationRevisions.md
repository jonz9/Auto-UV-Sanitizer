1. Material used to construct the box is made of cardboard rather than 3D-printed material, as time and cost was an issue.

2. UV-C LEDs used for the sanitation process are supplemented with red, bar LEDs with 635nm of wavelength instead due to safety concerns and the scope of this project.

3. Length was reduced by 3cm. Height was increased by 2cm. This change was made to make the project fit better above a door handle.
